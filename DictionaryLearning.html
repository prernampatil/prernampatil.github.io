        <h2>Asynchronous Dictionary Learning for Remote Sensing Imagery Classification</h2>
        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is an active area of research in the science and
            engineering domains. Among its many applications, machine
            learning has been used to classify hyperspectral imaging data. Large
            datasets and high computational complexity serve as barriers that
            limit the practical use of machine learning algorithms. As a potential
            technique to sidestep these barriers we took the novel approach of
            applying an asynchronous machine learning algorithm. We also
            evaluated the capability for such algorithms to be parallelized</p>
